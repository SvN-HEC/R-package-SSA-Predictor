# R-package SSA-Predictor
 
SSA-predictor (Simple Sign Accuracy): this is a generalization of the classic mean-square error (MSE) forecast paradigm 

There should be three folders in this package:
 
1. Data 

2. R: functions for computing the SSA criterion 

3. SSA Tutorials: sample R-code on various topics (introductory examples, forecasting, signal extraction with HP, BK and HF filters)


There’s also an R-project file named SSA_package.Rproj

Proceeding:

1. Open the R-project SSA_package (in Rstudio)

2. Once the project is opened (in Rstudio): load any of the tutorials from the folder `SSA Tutorials’

3. Depending on the tutorial one has to load additional R-packages (so called libraries) from CRAN such as xts, mFilter or packages for loading/updating the data. 

4. When all packages/libraries are loaded one can work through the tutorials
