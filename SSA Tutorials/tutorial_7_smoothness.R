# Smoothness


-Intuition: larger ht than target means that noisy-crossings at zero level are reduced; measure: ratio of amplitude functions as function of ht: tutorial
-Forecast horizon does not always address timeliness
1. If target = cycle then shift by delta implies phase-shift and effective lead
2. Counter example: weights first decay fast; after a while weights follow slow decay (for example large ar(1)). 
In this case, incerasing delta will lead higher lag at higher horizons i.e. lag instead of lead
-SSA-target: identity. Maximize b0 subject to ht. Add to tutorial. Alternative to HP
-First differences: transform cosine into sine i.e. out-of-phase cycle
1. Are we interested in the cycle or in the growth?
  2. In the latter case differences are OK
3. In the former case we obtain an out-of-phase cycle: should it be back-transformed or is the de-phased cycle more interesting than the original cycle in levels? 
  3.1 Peaks and troughs for original cycle
3.2 Zero-crossings for differenced cycle
3.3 Justifies SSA-criterion when applied to differences
