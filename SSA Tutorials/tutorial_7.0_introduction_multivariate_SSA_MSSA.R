# We here introduce to the M-SSA. see paper provide link???

# Example 1: we replicate the univariate SSA by M-SSA

# Example 2: we illustrate a bivariate M-SSA based on a `bogus' design 
#  -In principle the same as example 1 but we add an irrelevant (cross-sectionally uncorrelated white noise) series
